OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This KBase service provides a set of methods for manipulation 
and visualization of expression values organized as two-
dimentional matrix and assigned to genome features on one 
dimention and to different sorts conditions on second dimention.



VERSION: 0.7 (Released 8/21/2015)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- none

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Parameter max_items was added for hierarchical clustering 
allowing to slice top number of rows according to standard
deviation for rows

clustering
- Fix for bug in hierarchical clustering with limited max_items

------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- none

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:

------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- none

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:

to data from Narrative UI
- Cluster quality calculation was added in math layer (R-code)

related functions are now fully supported in API
